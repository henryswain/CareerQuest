• Team member 1: Henry Swain
o Stories completed
- updated comments
- restyled authenticator to fit withe the careerquest theme
- created and filled out readme
o Progress report
- restyling the authenticator was a pain since the documentation for custom styles 
is horrible and incomprehensive, and the way I wanted to do it ended up not being possible (I think it was more built into the javascript
of the componenet and less the css), but I was still able to make solid changes.
- the readme file was tedious but I think its looking pretty good now. Since I'm still a bit new to readme
 files, and it felt partially incomplete, I reached out to my group members for feedback, but I never heard back (despite multiple texts).
o Plan for next week
- not sure yet, will discuss next week
