* Team member 5: Magnolia Wallerich
o Stories completed
- Worked on restyling FindJobs as in certain cases such as when no jobs can be found with your filters I noticed it would break with our new footer
- Just started work on implementing dark mode for FindJobs
o Progress report
- Most of the not lightmode/darkmode specific styling is working just fine for the standard layout and I would consider it completed
- The implementation of darkmode is not complete as I haven't worked on it very much and it seems to be not working like how the rest of the pages do
o Plan for next week
- Figure out the issues with darkmode on FindJobs and try to finish it up
- Once FindJobs is well and complete I'd like to look towards other things we need to get implemented before the final presentation and focus on that
