o Progress report
- Presentation was completed on time and our actual talk part went alright as far as I can tell
- This time around we tried to have a more solid plan for submission and as far as I can tell that went better this sprint
o Plan for next week
- Figure out how to increase my memory allocation to VSCode for running the project as right now trying to "npm run dev" gives 
    errors relating to memory since the introduction of the translated CSV
- Investigate possible ways to make the project more efficient in an effort to decrease load times by figuring out what is 
    taking the longest when rendering the site
